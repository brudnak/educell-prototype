# Educell Personal Sandbox

## Student: Andrew Brudnak

Working on the International School Social Work Website - Educell. This is my personal sandbox for trying out creating prototypes and features separate from the main repository. This is for the Build Week: User Interface at Lambda School. I am part of the WEB20 cohort.
